<h3>Book me for Photographer Jobs</h3>

<h3>Use this Gallery on your Website</h3>
<p>If you are an ambituous or professional photographer and like what you see, you can use the gallery component used on this website for your own project(s)!</p>
<p>The software, which I have built from scratch (based on pure JavaScript in both front- and backend) comes with a <strong>flickr</strong>-plugin 
    to automatically synchronize images from any photographer platform or image cloud service with the ones on any web page. 
    Additional plugins for the integration of other services (e.g. <strong>Adobe Cloud</strong>, <strong>500px</strong>, <strong>Photo Bucket</strong>, <strong>Instagram</strong> etc.) 
    can be implemented on demand.</p>
<p>Please get in touch with me in order to find out how to integrate this gallery plugin into your website, (<strong>wordpress</strong>) blog or mobile application.</p>
<p>I will be happy to answer your questions and will adapt the software to your need at a reasonable rate.</p>
