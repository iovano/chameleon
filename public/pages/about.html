<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>
The first serious camera I held in my hands was my father´s Canon AE-1 in 1984. Ever since, I had been fascinated by photography. However, the years to come were primarily dominated by my devotion to playing piano and composing music, finally leading to a fairly successful career as an electronic musician (“teamore”) and a strong involvement in organizing parties and small (netaudio-)festivals in and around Berlin.

After I had replaced my dusty old Canon AE-1 with a Canon 400D, my passion for photography received its next substantial impetus from a trip to Granada in 2007. My arousing interest for portraying faces, nudes and bodyscapes led to an aggregation of studio equipment and finally to again replacing my camera. The Canon 5D II (along with an EF 24-105mm 4.0L) I purchased in preparation of a trip to Japan in February 2011 is the camera I still work with today.

    I like to focus my camera on:
</p>
<ul>
<li>street photography and urban exploration</li>
<li>nature and landscapes</li>
<li>society and gentrification</li>
<li>bodyscapes and nudes</li>
<li>portraits and people</li>
</ul>
